### How Anti-Spam Works:

- Anti-Spam feature in Tmail is designed to classify the messages as spam or not  with an configurable score threshold.
- Usually a message will only be considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria; matching just a single test will not usually be enough to reach the threshold.
- Spam is reported on a per user base.
- When a message is classified as spam, it will automatically moved to user's Spam folder

### Anti-Spam training

- You can manually mark emails as spam . This action provides feedback to the anti-spam system, helping it learn from user preferences.

2. Whitelisting:

- Conversely, you can mark legitimate emails as not spam or whitelist specific senders. This feedback helps the system refine its understanding of trusted sources.

3. Custom Filtering Rules:

- Tmail allows users to set up custom filtering rules. For example, you can create rules to automatically move emails containing certain keywords to the spam folder.
