# Extra features {#2}

This small page will present features specific to Twake-Mail.

## I. Team-mailboxes

 - "Team mailbox" typically refers to a shared mailbox or a collaborative inbox that multiple users or team members can access. A team mailbox is useful for managing emails collectively, allowing multiple team members to view, respond to, and manage emails in a shared space.

- The owner of the shared mailbox needs to grant permissions to other team members. This can usually be done through the mailbox settings by the administrator.

- Once permissions are set, team members can see the team-mailbox on foldet-tree on left panel. Each team-mailbox will contains:
  - (1) Team-mailbox name
  - (2) Email address of the team-maiilbox
