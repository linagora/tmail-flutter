This project aims at providing a multi-plateform mobile email application, running the [JMAP protocol](https://jmap.io/) and will also deliver additional 
features to the [TMail back-end](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-backend).

Here is how TMail looks like on a phone:

## FAQ

### **Why did you choose JMAP?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
That is a good question! **IMAP** is THE ubiquitous protocol people use to read their emails, THE norm.

Yet **IMAP** had been designed in another age, which resulted in a chatty patchwork of extensions. **IMAP** lacks decent synchronisation primitives to address real-time challenges modern mobile fleet requires, it consumes a lot of bandwith, requires a lot of roundtrips which means high latency.

We are not alone to say this! Big players of the field started their own [proprietary](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) [protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients/exchange-activesync/exchange-activesync?view=exchserver-2019) to address IMAP flaws, and inter-operable standard was yet to be found...

This, is where **[JMAP](https://jmap.io/)** comes to play! **JMAP** builds on decades of experience, and beautifully addresses these challenges using `HTTP` and `JSON` standards. Not only does it make applications easier to develop, we also strongly believes it results in an improved experience for the end user.

### **Can I use TMail with *any* JMAP server?**

Yes, you can use the TMail application with any JMAP server and benefits from **Tmail** ergonomy and ease of use.

### **I don't understand your app... I need help using it! HELP MEEEEEE...**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
Don't worry, we are here!

We plan on writing a user documentation, helping you navigating around the application, and detailing the few configurations you have to perform.

If what you are looking for is not in the *user guide* then ask us directly in the [issues](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/issues) first, we would be glad to help. But also glad to improve our documentation and maybe tweak slightly our UI (user interface).
</details>

### **What plateforms do you (plan to) target?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
First, we target Android, IOS mobiles. We also take care of tablets and large rendering space early on in the development process.

Then, we plan on introducing a desktop application.

This versatility is enabled by the use of the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/).
</details>

### **What would your roadmap look like?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
First, we plan to write a simple, multi-plateform JMAP email client. This includes reading your mails and mailboxes, managing them, sending emails, searching your emails. This will likely keep us busy by the end of 2021.

Then, we have plan for multiple features including:

  - Support for TMail encrypted mailbox (GPG)
  - Support for TMail shared mailboxes
  - Support for TMail filters
  - Interactions with some other software from [Linagora](https://linagora.com) including:
      - Sending attachments via [LinShare]() file sharing platform.
      - Transfering some attachments you received to [LinShare](https://www.linshare.org/fr/accueil/) file sharing platform.
      - Discussing some emails you received via [Twake](https://twake.app/en/) chat.
</details>

### **Any chance to support JMAP extension for calendar, contacts?**

No we do not plan to support such extensions, that are currently not standardized as RFCs, nor implemented on the TMail backend.

### **Do you have a web application for TMail?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
  Yes! It is still in early development but we do have one. It's easy for you to use locally, as you can just build a Docker
  image locally from the sources of this repository, or even use our official Docker image `linagora/tmail-web`.

  The web-app needs to include an environment file though (here you can see the dummy `env.file` at the root of the project),
  with a `SERVER_URL` parameter, so it knows to which backend it needs to connect to.

  For this to run it locally for example, 2 ways:

  #### Edit the environment file before the build

  Edit the `env.file` by replacing the default value of `SERVER_URL` to the one pointing to your JMAP backend server.
  Then build your docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t tmail-web:latest .
  ```

  Then you can just simply run your web-app like this:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -ti -p 8080:80 --name web tmail-web:latest
  ```

  Then go to http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to login against your JMAP backend using the TMail web-app.

  #### Mount an environment file when running the container

  You can use our official image `linagora/tmail-web` or just build the docker image locally without any prior changes:

  ```bash
  docker build -t tmail-web:latest .
  ```

  From then, create at the root of the project an environment file (like `env.dev.file`) where you put the `SERVER_URL`
  you want to connect to. Then, to mount it and override the default one while running the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -ti -p 8080:80 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/env.dev.file,target=/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/env.file --name web tmail-web:latest
  ```

  Then go to http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to login against your JMAP backend using the TMail web-app.

### **Your work is awesome! I would like to help you. What can I do?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
Thanks for the enthousiasm!

There are many ways to help us, and amongst them:

   - **Spread the word**: Tell people you like **TMail**, on social medias, via blog posts etc... 
   - **Give us feedbacks**... It's hard to make all good decisions from the first time. It is very likely we can benefit from *your* experience. Did you encountered annoying bugs? Do you think we can better arrange the layout? Do you think we are missing some features critical to you? Tell us in the [issues](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/issues).
 - I can code! **I wanna help ;-)**. Wow thanks! Let's discuss your project together in the [issues](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/issues) to get you on track!
</details>
 
 ### **Cool. I also want to write my own email application for JMAP. Can you help me?**
 
You would be pleased to know we contributes a [JMAP Dart client](https://github.com/linagora/jmap-dart-client) that you can reuse to write your own applications. Feels free to open pull requests and enrich it!
