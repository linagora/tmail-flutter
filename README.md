This project aims at providing a multi-platform mobile email application, running the [JMAP protocol](https://jmap.io/) and will also deliver additional 
features to the [Twake Mail back-end](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-backend).

Twake Mail is developed with love by [Linagora](https://linagora.com).

Here is how Twake Mail looks like on a phone:

Here is how Twake Mail looks like on a tablet:

## Build app
1. Go to root folder of project
2. Run `scripts/prebuild.sh` script
```
/bin/bash scripts/prebuild.sh
```
3. Build
+ iOS:
```
flutter build ios 
```

+ Android:
```
flutter build apk
```

+ Web:

change `SERVER_URL` in `env.file` with your JMAP server
```
SERVER_URL=http://your-jmap-server.domain
```
then run: 
```
flutter build web
```
or you can find our images in: https://hub.docker.com/r/linagora/tmail-web

## FAQ

### **Why did you choose JMAP?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
That is a good question! **IMAP** is THE ubiquitous protocol people use to read their emails, THE norm.

Yet **IMAP** had been designed in another age, which resulted in a chatty patchwork of extensions. **IMAP** lacks decent synchronization primitives to address real-time challenges modern mobile fleet requires, it consumes a lot of bandwidth, requires a lot of round trips which means high latency.

We are not alone to say this! Big players of the field started their own [proprietary](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) [protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients/exchange-activesync/exchange-activesync?view=exchserver-2019) to address IMAP flaws, and inter-operable standard was yet to be found...

This, is where **[JMAP](https://jmap.io/)** comes to play! **JMAP** builds on decades of experience, and beautifully addresses these challenges using `HTTP` and `JSON` standards. Not only does it make applications easier to develop, we also strongly believes it results in an improved experience for the end user.
</details>

### **Can I use Twake Mail with *any* JMAP server?**

Yes, you can use the Twake Mail application with any JMAP server and benefits from **Twake Mail**'s ease of use.

### **I don't understand your app... I need help using it! HELP MEEEEEE...**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
Don't worry, we are here!

We plan on writing a user documentation, helping you navigating around the application, and detailing the few configurations you have to perform.

If what you are looking for is not in the *user guide* then ask us directly in the [issues](https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter/issues) first, we would be glad to help. But also glad to improve our documentation and maybe tweak slightly our UI (user interface).
</details>

### **What platforms do you (plan to) target?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
First, we target Android, iOS mobiles. We also take care of tablets and large rendering space early on in the development process.

Then, we plan on introducing a desktop application.

This versatility is enabled by the use of the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/).
</details>

### **What would your roadmap look like?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
Now that we plan having a simple JMAP email client supporting Android, IOS, and a webmail, we are working on some extra features on top of the TeamMail backend, including:

 - Better filters, with more actions, and combining conditions
 - Restoring deleted messages
 - Delegating full access to others for instance your security
 - Labels for better sorting your emails across folders
 - Automated actions: archiving, emptying your trash, your spam folders
 - Running filters against a folder
 - Attachment thumbnails

We are also planning active work on drag and drops and other user experience / productivity enhancements.

We do not currently plan working on desktop applications, on websockets for push on top of TeamMail web but such contributions would be appreciated. We also 
welcome feedback and pull requests regarding Team-Mail portability (running TeamMail on top of third party mail servers).

First, we plan to write a simple, multi-platform JMAP email client. This includes reading your mails and mailboxes, managing them, sending emails, searching your emails. 
This will likely keep us busy by the end of 2021.

Then, we have plan for multiple features including:

  - Support for Twake Mail encrypted mailbox (GPG)
  - Interactions with some other software from [Linagora](https://linagora.com) including:
      - Sending attachments via [TDrive](https://github.com/linagora/TDrive) file sharing platform.
      - Transferring some attachments you received to [TDrive](https://github.com/linagora/TDrive) file sharing platform.
      - Discussing some emails you received via [Twake](https://twake.app/en/) chat.

### **Any chance to support JMAP extension for calendar, contacts?**

No we do not plan to support such extensions, that are currently not standardized as RFCs, nor implemented on the Twake Mail backend.

### **Do you have a web application for Twake Mail?**

<details>
  <summary>Read more...</summary>
  Yes! It is still in early development but we do have one. It's easy for you to use locally, as you can just build a Docker
  image locally from the sources of this repository, or even use our official Docker image `linagora/tmail-web`.

  The web-app needs to include an environment file though (here you can see the dummy `env.file` at the root of the project),
  with a `SERVER_URL` parameter, so it knows to which backend it needs to connect to.

  For this to run it locally for example, 2 ways:

  #### Edit the environment file before the build

  Edit the `env.file` by replacing the default value of `SERVER_URL` to the one pointing to your JMAP backend server.
  Then build your docker image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t tmail-web:latest .
  ```

  Then you can just simply run your web-app like this:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -ti -p 8080:80 --name web tmail-web:latest
  ```

  Then go to http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to login against your JMAP backend using the Twake Mail web-app.

  #### Mount an environment file when running the container

  You can use our official image `linagora/tmail-web` or just build the docker image locally without any prior changes:

  ```bash
  docker build -t tmail-web:latest .
  ```

  From then, create at the root of the project an environment file (like `env.dev.file`) where you put the `SERVER_URL`
  you want to connect to. Then, to mount it and override the default one while running the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -ti -p 8080:80 --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/env.dev.file,target=/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/env.file --name web tmail-web:latest
  ```

  Then go to http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to login against your JMAP backend using the TMail web-app.

  #### Using the docker-compose file

  We also include a [docker-compose.yaml](backend-docker/docker-compose.yaml) file so you can get a testing environment up quickly. This use our [tmail-backend](https://hub.docker.com/r/linagora/tmail-backend) image for the JMAP server.

  Here are the steps to setup:

  1. Generate JWT keys for `tmail-backend`:
  ```bash
  openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out jwt_privatekey
  openssl rsa -in jwt_privatekey -pubout -out jwt_publickey
  ```
  2. Edit the `env.file` and set `SERVER_URL` to `http://localhost/` (with the trailing slash)
  3. Run `docker compose up -d` to bring up both the frontend and the backend.
  4. Run `docker compose exec tmail-backend /root/provisioning/provisioning.sh` to provision some demo accounts (you don't have to let it run all the way).
  5. The TMail web-app should be available at `http://localhost:8080`. The credentials for demo accounts are:
  ```
  User: alice@localhost
  Password: aliceSecret

  User: bob@localhost
  Password: bobSecret

  User: empty@localhost
  Password: emptrySecret
  ```
