with any email server, we cannot assume here which would be the terms of the emails server owner privacy policy. Users are responsible of consulting and validating the privacy policy of the email

The present Privacy policy may be amended or changed at any time at LINAGORA's discretion and without any prior notice.

## Data processing operations

If supported by the email server, the fact that emails are received might transit through third party infrastructure ([firebase cloud messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)). 
In the process, no personal data is being exposed, and the Twake Mail application need to contact directly the mail server in order to gather the notification information.

## Application Permissions

In order to work smoothly on your device the Twake Mail application needs the following authorization:

 - `Files, documnents, and audio files`: This permission is used by Twake Mail to access files of your device and allows using those files as email attachments. Once selected files are uploaded to the remote 
email server.
 - `Photos and videos`: This permission is used by Twake Mail to access photos and videos and allows using those files as email attachments. Once selected files are uploaded to the remote 
email server.
 - `Contacts`: Used by Twake Mail for Email address auto-completion against local address book. Local address book are never uploaded to third-party. Only once an email is sent to a 
local contact, does the email server become aware of the mail address and display names of the contact.

Those rights are only intendeed to improve Twake Mail user experience. Twake Mail is still usable, with a reduced functional scope might the user deny permissions.

## Our guiding principles for privacy

Our personal data collection and processing comply with the GDPR principles and the following guidelines :

- Gathering & processing of personal data by LINAGORA is never an end in itself. It aims at achieving a legitimate and licit purpose, and is strictly proportionate and necessary to the achievement of said purpose.

- LINAGORA never keeps collected data any longer than strictly necessary to achieve the purpose it was collected for. If the purpose can be achieved with pseudonymized or anonymized personal data, then the collected data is pseudonymized or anonymized before being processed in order to achieve the purpose. When the data is no longer necessary for achieving the purpose, data is either destroyed, anonymized, or (when the law requires it) archived.

- When entrusting third-party partner companies with the task of subprocessing user personal data, LINAGORA takes care that such companies comply with a data privacy protection level at least equal to the level of protection provided to EU citizens by LINAGORA.
