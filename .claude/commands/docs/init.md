description: ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Analyze the codebase and create initial documentation
---

## Mission
Use `docs-manager` agent to analyze the codebase and create initial documentation:
- `docs/project-overview-pdr.md`: Project overview and PDR (Product Development Requirements)
- `docs/codebase-summary.md`: Codebase summary
- `docs/code-standards.md`: Codebase structure and code standards
- `docs/system-architecture.md`: System architecture
- Update `README.md` with initial documentation (keep it under 300 lines)

Use `docs/` directory as the source of truth for documentation.

**IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.
