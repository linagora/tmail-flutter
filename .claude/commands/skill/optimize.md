description: Optimize an existing agent skill
argument-hint: [skill-name] [prompt]

Think harder.
Use `skill-creator` and `claude-code` skills.
Use `docs-seeker` skills to search for documentation if needed.

## Arguments
SKILL: $1 (default: `*`)
PROMPT: $2 (default: empty)

## Your mission
Propose a plan to optimize an existing skill in `.claude/skills/${SKILL}` directory. 
When you finish, ask user to review your plan:
- If the user approve: Write down a plan follow "Output Requirements", then ask user if they want to start implementing.
- If the user reject: Revise the plan or ask more questions to clarify more about the user's request (ask one question at the time), then repeat the review process.

## Additional instructions
<additional-instructions>$PROMPT</additional-instructions>

## Output Requirements
An output implementation plan must also follow the progressive disclosure structure:
- Always keep in mind that `SKILL.md` and reference files should be token consumption efficient, so that **progressive disclosure** can be leveraged at best.
- Create a directory `plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-plan-name` (example: `plans/20251101-1505-authentication-and-profile-implementation`).
- Save the overview access point at `plan.md`, keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each phase with status/progress and links.
- For each phase, add `phase-XX-phase-name.md` files containing sections (Context links, Overview with date/priority/statuses, Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps).
